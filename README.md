## Notes

- Each folder is a separate project with its own dependencies and purpose.
- Some folders may have their own Git repository metadata (`.git` folders).  
- If you want to treat each as a standalone project, consider cloning or managing them individually.
- If you want to manage everything as a single repository, `.git` folders inside each project folder should be removed.
